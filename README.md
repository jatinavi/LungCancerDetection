# Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect lung cancer using histopathological image data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model classifies lung tissue into categories such as normal or cancerous, providing a robust tool for early cancer diagnosis.

# Features
	•	Dataset: Utilizes the Kaggle dataset Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images.
	•	Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding for efficient model input.
	•	Custom CNN: Built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
	•	Visualization: Interactive plots for data exploration and model performance.
	•	Evaluation: Accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrices to validate the model.

# Dataset Structure

The dataset contains two main categories:
	1.	Lung Image Sets:
	•	lung_aca (Lung Adenocarcinoma)
	•	lung_scc (Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma)
	•	lung_n (Normal Lung Tissue)
	2.	Colon Image Sets:
	•	colon_aca (Colon Adenocarcinoma)
	•	colon_n (Normal Colon Tissue)

# Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	TensorFlow/Keras
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
	•	OpenCV

# Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.

# How to Run
	1.	Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
	2.	Set the dataset path correctly in the code.
	3.	Execute the notebook step by step to:
	•	Load and preprocess the dataset.
	•	Train the CNN model.
	•	Evaluate and visualize the results.

# Results
	•	Model Accuracy: XX% on validation data
	•	Confusion Matrix: Demonstrates the classification performance across categories.
	•	Loss and Accuracy Plots: Shows the training process over epochs.

# Future Enhancements
	•	Improve the CNN architecture with pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG16, or Inception.
	•	Incorporate data augmentation to handle class imbalance.
	•	Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
